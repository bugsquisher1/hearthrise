-- ============================================================================
-- 2026-08-18-skill-row-upsert.sql — THE PERMANENT FIX FOR THE `unknown_skill`
-- INCIDENT: hr_apply's XP grant CREATES a missing player_skills row instead of
-- refusing the whole accrue.
--
-- Governing rule: CLAUDE.md "Server authority (locked 2026-08-10)".
--
-- ⚠ GENERATED. The restated hr_apply below is produced by
--   `node tools/derive-skill-row-upsert.mjs --write` from the CURRENT last
--   toucher (2026-08-18-equip-release-codes.sql) and patched at ONE named
--   anchor. Do NOT hand-edit it; `--check` runs in the suite and will fail.
--   Retyping a 69 KB body is how b346's ownership flag, b348's tool_carry key,
--   the S5 accrued_to stamp, the 12M XP clamp, the daily budget, Phase 0's
--   entire fight block and b366's five equip release codes silently disappear.
--
-- ── THE INCIDENT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The XP grant was an UPDATE with a row-count assertion:
--
--     update public.player_skills set xp = xp + v_n where ...;
--     get diagnostics v_rows = row_count;
--     if v_rows <> 1 then hr_reject('unknown_skill') end if;
--
-- which reports TWO unrelated facts with one code:
--   (1) the skill id is not in the catalogue        — a real deploy bug
--   (2) this character has no row for a REAL skill  — server bookkeeping
--
-- (2) is not an error. Per-skill rows are seeded ONCE, at character creation
-- (2026-08-14-character-bootstrap.sql), and the catalogue grows afterwards — so
-- every character older than a skill lacked its row. When Stonemason shipped,
-- pre-Stonemason characters got `unknown_skill` on a legitimate grant; the
-- refusal STORED itself against the intent key so "Try again" replayed it; and
-- because hr_reject rolls the protected block back WHOLE, each refusal also
-- discarded the ore, the gold and every other skill's XP in the same window.
-- 51 aggregated rejections at severity `incident` in a single night.
--
-- ⚠ PRODUCTION WAS BACKFILLED BY HAND that night (all user/slot × hr_skills
--   pairs exist), so this file does NOT need to repair data — and MUST be
--   correct on a fresh database too, where those rows do not exist. It is: the
--   upsert covers both, which is exactly why the fix is in the grant and not in
--   a one-off backfill or in the bootstrap seed (which runs once and cannot see
--   a catalogue that grows later).
--
-- ── WHAT IT SHIPS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   §1  hr_apply     the XP grant becomes
--                      `if not exists (select 1 from hr_skills ...) -> reject`
--                    + `insert ... on conflict (user_id, slot, skill_id)
--                       do update set xp = player_skills.xp + v_n`
--   §2  grants       revoke from PUBLIC first, then hr_engine
--   §3  self-verification — the commit gate
--
-- ── WHY THE ORDER OF THE TWO STATEMENTS IS LOAD-BEARING ─────────────────
-- There is NO foreign key from player_skills.skill_id to hr_skills — the FK is
-- to player_state(user_id, slot). A bare upsert would therefore SUCCEED on a
-- junk client string and mint a skill row out of it. The catalogue check is the
-- validation; the upsert is only the write.
--
-- ── WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The bootstrap seed is already correct (`from public.hr_skills left join
-- hr_start_skill_xp`, i.e. a row per catalogue skill) and lives in a DIFFERENT
-- FILE: 2026-08-14-character-bootstrap.sql's `create or replace` of
-- public.hr_create_character, which supersedes 2026-08-11-player-state.sql's
-- hardcoded fifteen-entry `c_start_skills` array. It is not in hr_apply's body
-- and is deliberately not restated here. §3(g) asserts it still seeds from the
-- catalogue, so this file notices if that ever changes — but note that seeding
-- at creation CANNOT fix the incident, because the catalogue grows after a
-- character is created and nothing re-seeds. The upsert is the fix; the seed is
-- only the reason a FRESH character rarely needs it.
--
-- ── REVERSIBILITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Additive and behaviour-WIDENING in one direction only: every delta the
-- previous body accepted is still accepted with an identical result (an
-- existing row takes the `do update` arm, which is the same arithmetic as the
-- UPDATE it replaces), and the only deltas whose outcome changes are ones that
-- previously FAILED. `unknown_skill` is raised strictly more narrowly.
-- Reverting means re-applying 2026-08-18-equip-release-codes.sql, which restores
-- the UPDATE; no data is touched in either direction, and rows this file created
-- are indistinguishable from bootstrap-seeded ones. The Edge payload does not
-- depend on this file — SAFE IN EITHER ORDER with a deploy.
--
-- ⚠ THIS FILE IS NOW THE LAST ONE THAT REPLACES hr_apply. A later file that
--   also replaces it would silently delete this change. That ordering lives in
--   tests/schema-apply-order.json and is enforced by the replay.

  -- BLAST-RADIUS CLAMPS. NOT balance, NOT player-facing. They are the blast
  -- radius if an Edge Function is ever wrong or compromised, exactly as the
  -- clamps in clan_deposit (2026-08-08-clan-seat.sql:530) are. Set far above
  -- honest play.
  --
  -- ── WHAT THESE CLAMPS ACTUALLY BUY, STATED HONESTLY (Security, 2026-08-11) ──
  -- The flattering version of this control is "one compromised call cannot max
  -- a skill from zero". That is TRUE at 5,000,000 and at 12,000,000 and it is
  -- nearly WORTHLESS, because nothing limits a compromised engine to one call:
  -- hr_rate_gate allows 30 accrues/minute, so the reachable rate is 150M XP/min
  -- at 5M and 360M XP/min at 12M. Against an attacker with the engine, the
  -- per-call clamp is a speed bump measured in seconds either way.
  --
  -- What it DOES buy, and the reason it is worth having:
  --   1. It stops a single bad delta from an HONEST-BUT-BUGGY engine. The
  --      `interval_ms` class is the live example: one request field taken from
  --      the client turns a 12h absence into ~43.2M ticks instead of ~18,000 —
  --      a ~2400x mint that proposes roughly 6.8 BILLION XP. That is refused
  --      identically at 5M and at 12M. Almost every real defect looks like
  --      this: not "slightly too much", but three orders of magnitude too much.
  --   2. It keeps ledger rows small-grained, so anomaly detection has something
  --      to detect. A clamp is also a bucket size.
  --
  -- ⚠ A clamp rejection is therefore NOT automatically an incident. Before the
  --   degrade ladder in hr-accrue/index.ts it was closer to one — a rejection
  --   rolled back the watermark with the payment and bricked accrual. It is now
  --   recoverable, and honest play at maximum gear over a 24h cap can approach
  --   these numbers on its own. Read a rejection as EITHER an incident OR a
  --   balance change that outgrew its blast radius, and check
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs' clamp-headroom report before assuming which.
  --
  -- c_max_xp_delta: 5,000,000 -> 12,000,000 on 2026-08-11 (Security ruling).
  --   At 5M the worst honest case measured by clampGuard was inside the 60%
  --   HEADROOM line but close enough that a single balance change would fire
  --   it; at 12M the same worst case is ~23.6%. HEADROOM stays at 0.60 in
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs — moving BOTH the clamp and the line is how you
  --   arrive at a guard that structurally cannot fire. Only this one clamp
  --   moved; gold, items, kinds and progress all have real margin already.
  --   The surviving property is asserted, not documented: clampGuard requires
  --   c_max_xp_delta < 13,034,431 = xpForLevel(99), i.e. one call can still

  -- ⚠ THE INTENT KEYS A REJECTION MUST RELEASE (Security F3, 2026-08-16).
  --   Step (5) releases a claimed key on `version_conflict` because the accrual
  --   engine DERIVES its key from (user, slot, watermark, version, salt) and a
  --   rejection moves neither watermark nor version — so an honest retry
  --   re-derives a byte-identical key and replays the stored rejection until
  --   hr_intents_prune, up to 25 hours later.
  --
  --   The `fight` codes have exactly that shape, and the trigger is a ROUTINE
  --   OPERATION rather than an attack: change a monster's hp in
  --   src/data/monsters.js and deploy the Edge payload BEFORE re-applying
  --   2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every honest checkpoint for that
  --   monster proposes an hp above the stale ceiling. Refused, key bricked,
  --   every player on that monster frozen for a day — and re-applying the
  --   catalogue would NOT unfreeze them, because the replay never re-evaluates.
  --
  --   THE RULE, STATED AS A PROPERTY RATHER THAN AS A LIST: release a claimed
  --   key when the refusal is a function of SERVER STATE THAT CAN CHANGE
  --   UNDERNEATH AN UNCHANGED DELTA — the row version, or the catalogue the
  --   clamp is re-derived from. Everything else is a decision about the delta
  --   itself and deserves the same answer on the same key. Nothing is released
  --   that EXECUTED anything: a rejection rolled the protected block back, so a
  --   re-run is a first run.
  --   ⚠ THE LIST ROTTED IN ONE DAY, exactly as predicted (b361 incident):
  --   Stonemason shipped to clients minutes before its hr_skills row landed,
  --   `unknown_skill` fired for two LIVE players, stored itself against their
  --   accrue keys, and "Try again" replayed the stored refusal after the
  --   catalogue was fixed — the F3 brick, second instance, severity incident.
  --   `unknown_skill` / `unknown_item` / `unknown_activity` are all functions
  --   of catalogue state (hr_skills / hr_items / hr_activities) and were
  --   always in the property's scope; they are now in the list. If you add a
  --   catalogue-validated refusal code to hr_apply, IT GOES HERE TOO.
  --   ⚠ b366 — THE EQUIP BLOCK JOINS THE LIST, AND IT IS THE SAME LESSON A
  --   SECOND TIME. Until b366 nothing could reach hr_apply's equip block
  --   through a player gesture (there was no equip verb anywhere in src/net,
  --   which is the root of the b362 dupe class), so its refusals were
  --   unreachable and none of them was ever considered here. The equip verb
  --   makes all five reachable, and FOUR of them are functions of a GENERATED
  --   catalogue — hr_equip_slots, hr_items, hr_item_slots — i.e. exactly the
  --   "server state that can change underneath an unchanged delta" the property
  --   above names. The routine operation that trips it is a deploy-order slip:
  --   add an item to src/data/items.js, deploy the Edge payload BEFORE
  --   re-applying 2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every equip of that
  --   item is unknown_item — and STAYS unknown_item for that key even after the
  --   catalogue lands, because a replay never re-evaluates.
  --   `requirement_not_met` is here for the same reason with a different table:
  --   it is derived from player_skills through hr_level_from_xp, and an XP
  --   grant that lands between two attempts changes the answer to an unchanged
  --   delta.
  --   `bad_equip` is a SHAPE refusal and is here only because hr_apply raises
  --   it for a delta whose shape depends on nothing but itself — releasing it
  --   is harmless (the block rolled back) and keeping it off the list would
  --   brick a key on a client bug that a redeploy fixes.
  --   ⚠ `insufficient_item` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. "You do not own one" is a
  --   fact about the PLAYER'S OWN ROW, not about a catalogue, and it is the
  --   ownership check that makes equipping a conserving transfer. Releasing it
  --   would hand a client an unlimited number of free re-attempts on one key
  --   against a moving inventory — which is the retry loop a dupe wants.

  --        does here (game_events: 1.6M rows / 229 MB, six players, 3.45 days).
  --        Now only `{ok}` (plus the error and its detail on a rejection) is
  --        stored — tens of bytes — and a REPLAY OF A SUCCESS RE-DERIVES the
  --        current state. That is strictly better for the caller too: a retry

  --        ── ONE NAMESPACE, TWO KINDS OF KEY (review S6) ──────────────────
  --        `player_intents` is keyed on (user_id, intent_id) and NOTHING else,
  --        so a client-supplied uuid (market_list / market_cancel / market_buy
  --        all take p_intent_id straight from the browser) shares a namespace
  --        with keys the SERVER derives — the accrual engine's key is
  --        sha256(user, slot, watermark, …), and `accrued_to` is a value
  --        hr_load hands the client so it can render a countdown.
  --
  --        Left alone, that is a self-denial-of-service with a nasty shape: a
  --        player computes their own next accrual key, burns it with a market
  --        call, and every accrual from then on returns `replayed: true`,
  --        applies nothing, and never advances the watermark — silently, with
  --        ok:true, until hr_intents_prune deletes the row 24 hours later.
  --
  --        The fix is to notice that a replay must be a replay OF THE SAME
  --        THING. `player_intents.intent` already records what the key was
  --        claimed for; if the incoming call names a different one, this is not
  --        a retry, it is a collision — deliberate or accidental — and the
  --        honest answer is to refuse rather than to hand back someone else's
  --        decision. One comparison, and it hardens every intent in the system,
  --        not just accrual. (The accrual key is ALSO salted with hr_seed's
  --        server secret now, so it cannot be computed in the first place; these
  --        are two independent locks and the cheap one lives here.)

    -- The per-call clamps below are a blast radius for ONE call. Nothing
    -- restricts a compromised engine to one call — hr_rate_gate allows 30
    -- accrues/minute — so without a per-DAY ceiling the reachable rate is
    -- 518 BILLION XP/day, i.e. every skill in the game to 99 every two seconds.
    -- This is the ceiling. Design, numbers and the composition argument against
    -- the b307 per-absence cap: supabase/migrations/2026-08-11-daily-budget.sql.
    --
    -- WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY EXACTLY HERE:
    --   • AFTER the advisory lock and the `for update` above, so the sum and
    --     the row it will insert are inside one serialised critical section for
    --     this character. Two concurrent applies cannot both read a
    --     pre-insert world (hr_day_budget_used is VOLATILE — see its header).
    --   • AFTER the version check, so a stale caller pays `version_conflict`
    --     without a ledger scan.
    --   • AFTER the per-call clamps, and that ordering was decided by a test
    --     rather than by taste. With the budget checked first, the conservation
    --     fuzz's `gold_clamp` op — a deliberate 6.8e9-class delta — came back
    --     `daily_budget`, because the day's gold ceiling (25,000,000) is BELOW
    --     the per-call gold clamp (50,000,000). c_max_gold_delta would have
    --     become unreachable: a control that reads as a control in review and
    --     can never fire. Clamps answer "this ONE delta is insane"; the budget
    --     answers "you have had enough today". The specific diagnosis wins.
    --   • STILL INSIDE the protected block, before the state UPDATE and before
    --     the ledger row, so a breach rolls back everything the earlier blocks
    --     wrote through the same hr_reject/HR000 path as any other rejection.
    --     `daily_budget` never half-applies; the fuzz asserts that by
    --     reconciling after it.
    --   • GROSS inflow only. Netting a spend against a mint would give the
    --     budget a free reset button (mint 25M, buy something, mint again).
    --   • UNCONDITIONAL on journal.kind. `kind` is chosen by the caller; a
    --     budget that only counted kind='accrue' would be evaded by writing
    --     kind='trade'. Real transfers do not pass through hr_apply — market_buy

  -- ── (5) Record the DECISION under the idempotency key. This statement is

  --        a rejected intent returns the same rejection instead of re-running
  --        it. Only the decision is stored, never the state envelope (R5, and
  --        the reasoning is at step (3)) — on a success that is literally
  --        `{"ok": true}`.
  --
  --        ── ONE EXCEPTION: A VERSION CONFLICT RELEASES THE KEY (b346) ──────
  --        "Same key, same answer" is the right contract for a decision about
  --        the DELTA — a clamp, an insufficiency, an unknown id. The caller must
  --        change something, and changing the key is how it says "this is a new
  --        attempt". `version_conflict` is not that. It is a statement about the
  --        caller's READ: nothing was applied, the protected block rolled back
  --        in full, and the DEFINED recovery is "re-read and try again".
  --
  --        Storing it turns an ordinary concurrency outcome into a lockout for
  --        any caller whose key cannot change. Measured on this database
  --        2026-08-15, rolled back:
  --            (1) apply, stale version      -> {ok:false, version_conflict}
  --            (2) retry SAME key, CORRECT   -> {ok:false, version_conflict,
  --                                              replayed:true}
  --            (3) control, NEW key, CORRECT -> {ok:true}
  --        Same delta, same correct version; only the key differed. The accrual
  --        engine's key is DERIVED from (user, slot, watermark, version, salt)
  --        and a rejection does not move the watermark, so before this it could
  --        re-derive a byte-identical, permanently-refused key — for up to 25
  --        hours (hr_intents_prune, 17 * * * *, 24h window). The Edge side
  --        additionally puts `version` in that derivation; this is the half that
  --        also covers the CLIENT-chosen keys, which cannot re-derive anything.
  --
  --        NARROW ON PURPOSE. `v_claimed` means this call inserted the row, so a
  --        rejection returned from step (3) — including an intent_mismatch
  --        against a row recording somebody's SUCCESS — never reaches here and
  --        can never free that row. And only `version_conflict` is released:
  --        every other code is a decision about the delta and deserves the same
  --        answer on the same key.
