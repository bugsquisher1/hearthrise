-- Hearthrise — HUNT SESSIONS: THE AWAY MODEL, DELETED OUTRIGHT (lane C2, the
-- closed rebuild — Tyler 2026-10-15: "the game is closed and will be WIPED. No
-- back-compat, no carry/conversion code, no hide-then-delete; old systems are
-- deleted outright"; "auto eat is moot").
-- STAGED, NOT APPLIED — Security GO REQUIRED (it restates hr_apply, the money
-- engine). Lane C: the Coordinator applies (tools/apply-migration.mjs, one
-- file, never inside begin/commit, never 00:00–00:10 UTC).
--
-- ORDER: AFTER 2026-10-22-hunt-sessions-settle.sql AND AFTER the hr-accrue
-- payload that no longer proposes the deleted keys is live (pack-edge --hash ==
-- the deployed payload_sha256): an older edge still sends `last_away_receipt`,
-- `consec_falls` and activity `stance`/`stop`, which this hr_apply refuses
-- (`unknown_delta_key` / `bad_activity`) — every gather/artisan settle of that
-- edge would 409. BEFORE 2026-10-22-hunt-sessions-arm.sql. CLIENT HALF: the
-- client stops reading the projection keys below and stops calling
-- hr_set_auto_eat / hr_credit_kills / hr_vigour_refill (lanes D1 / R1 / B1);
-- a client that still calls one gets "function does not exist".
--
-- SUPERSEDES the two files C2 staged under "swap then delete" and never
-- applied (2026-10-22-hunt-sessions-away-readers.sql, -drop-away.sql): the
-- closed rebuild deletes the gather receipt with the combat one, so there is
-- nothing left to keep for lane G.
--
-- ── WHAT IT DELETES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   AUTO-EAT        player_state.auto_eat_enabled / _food / _pct / _set_at;
--                   hr_set_auto_eat (client RPC + baseline row), hr_auto_eat_tier,
--                   hr_auto_eat_max_pct; the bootstrap's switch-on and free
--                   'trait:auto_eat' flag (hr_create_character); a trait's
--                   switch-on (hr_trait_buy__ungated §10); the death row's
--                   `auto_eat_enabled` key (hr_apply). The action bar is the
--                   only eater (B1's bar).
--   THE RECEIPT     player_state.last_away_receipt; hr_apply's allowlist key,
--                   its (4a-r) validation and its SET write; hr_state_of's
--                   projection. The edge's away-receipt.js is deleted with it.
--   VIGOUR          hr_vigour_of, hr_vigour_refill (+ __ungated),
--                   hr_vigour_refill_price, the hr_vigour_price_rule table, and
--                   hr_state_of's `vigour` block. Stamina is the hunt's meter.
--   STANCES/RETREAT player_state.hunt_stance / hunt_stop; hr_apply's activity
--                   keys `stance`/`stop` and their SET writes; hr_apply's
--                   `consec_falls` key, (4a-c) validation and SET write;
--                   hr_state_of's `hunt_stance`/`hunt_stop`/`consec_falls` and
--                   the pointer-era `hunt_analyzer` projection; the old
--                   hr_hunt_analyzer(uuid, int) it called (the C1 session
--                   analyzer hr_hunt_analyzer(int, uuid) is a different
--                   function and stays). The retired party settle's key
--                   allowlist loses `consec_falls` with hr_apply's (§1e).
--   ATTENDED CREDIT hr_credit_kills (+ __ungated, client RPC + baseline row),
--                   hr_attended_kills.
--
-- ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES (each has a later owner) ───────────────────
--   player_state.consec_falls, hr_hunt_stances, hr_hunt_stop_valid — the PARTY
--     settle still reads them; parties are dropped by the demolition M2
--     restatement (the edge no longer drives a party at all as of this lane).
--   hr_credit_combat_xp (+ __ungated, combat_xp_accrued_to, its log and prune
--     cron) — already refuses a hunter (settle §6b); it is the client-fight XP
--     door R1 retires with the client combat loop.
--   hr_offline_cap_ms / the gather presence horizon — gather/artisan accrual
--     still prices an absence with it until lane G gives them sessions.
--   The ledger kinds and hr_apply's c_ledger_kinds — append-only history
--     (demolition safety review item 20).
--   hr_rpc_gate's inert 'hr_credit_kills' / 'hr_vigour_refill' bucket strings
--     and hr_assert_grant_hygiene's allowlist text — DATA, not calls; the
--     demolition M1 restatement of both re-derives them.
--
-- ── HOW: FOUR WHOLE RESTATEMENTS, PINNED ───────────────────────────────────
--   hr_apply, hr_state_of, hr_create_character and hr_trait_buy__ungated are
--   RESTATED WHOLE from the installed body with the deleted blocks cut out —
--   nothing else in any body moves (the restatement is the chain-end
--   pg_get_functiondef, transformed by exact-once block cuts). §0 refuses
--   unless each installed body is EXACTLY the pre-image this file was cut from
--   (md5 of prosrc) or already this file's own restatement, so a body another
--   file moved meanwhile is refused, never clobbered. CREATE OR REPLACE keeps
--   every grant; §3 re-asserts them.
--
-- ── MONEY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   No clamp, balance, conservation term or grant moves. Every removed line
--   DESCRIBED value (a receipt, a setting, a standing order, a meta key) or
--   gated a feature that no longer exists; the Vigour refill (a gold sink) is
--   dropped and was already revoked from clients by the settle file. §4 asserts
--   an ordinary gold + item + death apply still lands and journals.
--
-- ── REVERSIBILITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--   The beta is wiped; the dropped columns held display state and settings, no
--   balance. A revert re-applies the four pre-image bodies (pg_get_functiondef
--   taken before the apply) and re-runs the original migrations of the dropped
--   objects (2026-08-15-auto-eat*.sql, 2026-09-07-last-away-receipt.sql,
--   2026-09-22-vigour*.sql, 2026-09-22-hunt-stance*.sql, the attended-kills
--   files). No begin/commit (CLAUDE.md §2).
--
-- ⚠ AFTER APPLYING: live-hash-drift --live --write (the four bodies + the
--   dropped functions), restore-census (the dropped table), re-pin
--   tests/no-client-copy-of-projection.baseline.json's state keys.

  -- BLAST-RADIUS CLAMPS. NOT balance, NOT player-facing. They are the blast
  -- radius if an Edge Function is ever wrong or compromised, exactly as the
  -- clamps in clan_deposit (2026-08-08-clan-seat.sql:530) are. Set far above
  -- honest play.
  --
  -- ── WHAT THESE CLAMPS ACTUALLY BUY, STATED HONESTLY (Security, 2026-08-11) ──
  --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
  -- The flattering version of this control is "one compromised call cannot max
  -- a skill from zero". That is TRUE at 5,000,000 and at 12,000,000 and it is
  -- nearly WORTHLESS, because nothing limits a compromised engine to one call:
  -- hr_rate_gate allows 30 accrues/minute, so the reachable rate is 150M XP/min
  -- at 5M and 360M XP/min at 12M. Against an attacker with the engine, the
  -- per-call clamp is a speed bump measured in seconds either way.
  --
  -- What it DOES buy, and the reason it is worth having:
  --   1. It stops a single bad delta from an HONEST-BUT-BUGGY engine. The
  --      `interval_ms` class is the live example: one request field taken from
  --      the client turns a 12h absence into ~43.2M ticks instead of ~18,000 —
  --      a ~2400x mint that proposes roughly 6.8 BILLION XP. That is refused
  --      identically at 5M and at 12M. Almost every real defect looks like
  --      this: not "slightly too much", but three orders of magnitude too much.
  --   2. It keeps ledger rows small-grained, so anomaly detection has something
  --      to detect. A clamp is also a bucket size.
  --
  -- ⚠ A clamp rejection is therefore NOT automatically an incident. Before the
  --   degrade ladder in hr-accrue/index.ts it was closer to one — a rejection
  --   rolled back the watermark with the payment and bricked accrual. It is now
  --   recoverable, and honest play at maximum gear over a 24h cap can approach
  --   these numbers on its own. Read a rejection as EITHER an incident OR a
  --   balance change that outgrew its blast radius, and check
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs' clamp-headroom report before assuming which.
  --
  -- c_max_xp_delta: 5,000,000 -> 12,000,000 on 2026-08-11 (Security ruling).
  --   At 5M the worst honest case measured by clampGuard was inside the 60%
  --   HEADROOM line but close enough that a single balance change would fire
  --   it; at 12M the same worst case is ~23.6%. HEADROOM stays at 0.60 in
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs — moving BOTH the clamp and the line is how you
  --   arrive at a guard that structurally cannot fire. Only this one clamp
  --   moved; gold, items, kinds and progress all have real margin already.
  --   The surviving property is asserted, not documented: clampGuard requires
  --   c_max_xp_delta < 13,034,431 = xpForLevel(99), i.e. one call can still

  --   rejection moves neither watermark nor version — so an honest retry
  --   re-derives a byte-identical key and replays the stored rejection until
  --   hr_intents_prune, up to 25 hours later.
  --
  --   The `fight` codes have exactly that shape, and the trigger is a ROUTINE
  --   OPERATION rather than an attack: change a monster's hp in
  --   src/data/monsters.js and deploy the Edge payload BEFORE re-applying
  --   2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every honest checkpoint for that
  --   monster proposes an hp above the stale ceiling. Refused, key bricked,
  --   every player on that monster frozen for a day — and re-applying the
  --   catalogue would NOT unfreeze them, because the replay never re-evaluates.
  --
  --   THE RULE, STATED AS A PROPERTY RATHER THAN AS A LIST: release a claimed
  --   key when the refusal is a function of SERVER STATE THAT CAN CHANGE
  --   UNDERNEATH AN UNCHANGED DELTA — the row version, or the catalogue the
  --   clamp is re-derived from. Everything else is a decision about the delta
  --   itself and deserves the same answer on the same key. Nothing is released
  --   that EXECUTED anything: a rejection rolled the protected block back, so a
  --   re-run is a first run.
  --   ⚠ THE LIST ROTTED IN ONE DAY, exactly as predicted (b361 incident):
  --   Stonemason shipped to clients minutes before its hr_skills row landed,
  --   `unknown_skill` fired for two LIVE players, stored itself against their
  --   accrue keys, and "Try again" replayed the stored refusal after the
  --   catalogue was fixed — the F3 brick, second instance, severity incident.
  --   `unknown_skill` / `unknown_item` / `unknown_activity` are all functions
  --   of catalogue state (hr_skills / hr_items / hr_activities) and were
  --   always in the property's scope; they are now in the list. If you add a
  --   catalogue-validated refusal code to hr_apply, IT GOES HERE TOO.
  --   ⚠ b366 — THE EQUIP BLOCK JOINS THE LIST, AND IT IS THE SAME LESSON A
  --   SECOND TIME. Until b366 nothing could reach hr_apply's equip block
  --   through a player gesture (there was no equip verb anywhere in src/net,
  --   which is the root of the b362 dupe class), so its refusals were
  --   unreachable and none of them was ever considered here. The equip verb
  --   makes all five reachable, and FOUR of them are functions of a GENERATED
  --   catalogue — hr_equip_slots, hr_items, hr_item_slots — i.e. exactly the
  --   "server state that can change underneath an unchanged delta" the property
  --   above names. The routine operation that trips it is a deploy-order slip:
  --   add an item to src/data/items.js, deploy the Edge payload BEFORE
  --   re-applying 2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every equip of that
  --   item is unknown_item — and STAYS unknown_item for that key even after the
  --   catalogue lands, because a replay never re-evaluates.
  --   `requirement_not_met` is here for the same reason with a different table:
  --   it is derived from player_skills through hr_level_from_xp, and an XP
  --   grant that lands between two attempts changes the answer to an unchanged
  --   delta.
  --   `bad_equip` is a SHAPE refusal and is here only because hr_apply raises
  --   it for a delta whose shape depends on nothing but itself — releasing it
  --   is harmless (the block rolled back) and keeping it off the list would
  --   brick a key on a client bug that a redeploy fixes.
  --   ⚠ `insufficient_item` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. "You do not own one" is a
  --   fact about the PLAYER'S OWN ROW, not about a catalogue, and it is the
  --   ownership check that makes equipping a conserving transfer. Releasing it
  --   would hand a client an unlimited number of free re-attempts on one key
  --   against a moving inventory — which is the retry loop a dupe wants.

  --        Revision 2 stored the ENTIRE hr_state_of envelope — inventory,
  --        fifteen skills, farm plots, progress — in player_intents.result, per
  --        intent, at up to 240 applies/min/player. That is a full state
  --        snapshot roughly every quarter second per player, retained 24 hours:
  --        ~2 KB × 240 × 60 × 24 = 690 MB PER PLAYER PER DAY at the rate limit,
  --        and this repo already has the receipt for what an unbounded journal
  --        does here (game_events: 1.6M rows / 229 MB, six players, 3.45 days).
  --        Now only `{ok}` (plus the error and its detail on a rejection) is
  --        stored — tens of bytes — and a REPLAY OF A SUCCESS RE-DERIVES the
  --        current state. That is strictly better for the caller too: a retry
  --        gets fresh state and a fresh version instead of a stale snapshot it
  --        would then have to discard. The contract is unchanged and is the one
  --        that matters: the same key applies the effect exactly once.

  --        ── ONE NAMESPACE, TWO KINDS OF KEY (review S6) ──────────────────
  --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
  --        `player_intents` is keyed on (user_id, intent_id) and NOTHING else,
  --        so a client-supplied uuid (market_list / market_cancel / market_buy
  --        all take p_intent_id straight from the browser) shares a namespace
  --        with keys the SERVER derives — the accrual engine's key is
  --        sha256(user, slot, watermark, …), and `accrued_to` is a value
  --        hr_load hands the client so it can render a countdown.
  --
  --        Left alone, that is a self-denial-of-service with a nasty shape: a
  --        player computes their own next accrual key, burns it with a market
  --        call, and every accrual from then on returns `replayed: true`,
  --        applies nothing, and never advances the watermark — silently, with
  --        ok:true, until hr_intents_prune deletes the row 24 hours later.
  --
  --        The fix is to notice that a replay must be a replay OF THE SAME
  --        THING. `player_intents.intent` already records what the key was
  --        claimed for; if the incoming call names a different one, this is not
  --        a retry, it is a collision — deliberate or accidental — and the
  --        honest answer is to refuse rather than to hand back someone else's
  --        decision. One comparison, and it hardens every intent in the system,
  --        not just accrual. (The accrual key is ALSO salted with hr_seed's
  --        server secret now, so it cannot be computed in the first place; these
  --        are two independent locks and the cheap one lives here.)

    -- ── (4b) THE LEDGER-DERIVED DAILY BUDGET (C5 / X3) ───────────────────
    --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
    -- The per-call clamps below are a blast radius for ONE call. Nothing
    -- restricts a compromised engine to one call — hr_rate_gate allows 30
    -- accrues/minute — so without a per-DAY ceiling the reachable rate is
    -- 518 BILLION XP/day, i.e. every skill in the game to 99 every two seconds.
    -- This is the ceiling. Design, numbers and the composition argument against
    -- the b307 per-absence cap: supabase/migrations/2026-08-11-daily-budget.sql.
    --
    -- WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY EXACTLY HERE:
    --   • AFTER the advisory lock and the `for update` above, so the sum and
    --     the row it will insert are inside one serialised critical section for
    --     this character. Two concurrent applies cannot both read a
    --     pre-insert world (hr_day_budget_used is VOLATILE — see its header).
    --   • AFTER the version check, so a stale caller pays `version_conflict`
    --     without a ledger scan.
    --   • AFTER the per-call clamps, and that ordering was decided by a test
    --     rather than by taste. With the budget checked first, the conservation
    --     fuzz's `gold_clamp` op — a deliberate 6.8e9-class delta — came back
    --     `daily_budget`, because the day's gold ceiling (25,000,000) is BELOW
    --     the per-call gold clamp (50,000,000). c_max_gold_delta would have
    --     become unreachable: a control that reads as a control in review and
    --     can never fire. Clamps answer "this ONE delta is insane"; the budget
    --     answers "you have had enough today". The specific diagnosis wins.
    --   • STILL INSIDE the protected block, before the state UPDATE and before
    --     the ledger row, so a breach rolls back everything the earlier blocks
    --     wrote through the same hr_reject/HR000 path as any other rejection.
    --     `daily_budget` never half-applies; the fuzz asserts that by
    --     reconciling after it.
    --   • GROSS inflow only. Netting a spend against a mint would give the
    --     budget a free reset button (mint 25M, buy something, mint again).
    --   • UNCONDITIONAL on journal.kind. `kind` is chosen by the caller; a
    --     budget that only counted kind='accrue' would be evaded by writing
    --     kind='trade'. Real transfers do not pass through hr_apply — market_buy

    -- version_conflict refusals against the very client that just settled.

  --        ── ONE EXCEPTION: A VERSION CONFLICT RELEASES THE KEY (b346) ──────
  --    introduced by 2026-08-15-intent-key-hygiene.sql
  --        "Same key, same answer" is the right contract for a decision about
  --        the DELTA — a clamp, an insufficiency, an unknown id. The caller must
  --        change something, and changing the key is how it says "this is a new
  --        attempt". `version_conflict` is not that. It is a statement about the
  --        caller's READ: nothing was applied, the protected block rolled back
  --        in full, and the DEFINED recovery is "re-read and try again".
  --
  --        Storing it turns an ordinary concurrency outcome into a lockout for
  --        any caller whose key cannot change. Measured on this database
  --        2026-08-15, rolled back:
  --            (1) apply, stale version      -> {ok:false, version_conflict}
  --            (2) retry SAME key, CORRECT   -> {ok:false, version_conflict,
  --                                              replayed:true}
  --            (3) control, NEW key, CORRECT -> {ok:true}
  --        Same delta, same correct version; only the key differed. The accrual
  --        engine's key is DERIVED from (user, slot, watermark, version, salt)
  --        and a rejection does not move the watermark, so before this it could
  --        re-derive a byte-identical, permanently-refused key — for up to 25
  --        hours (hr_intents_prune, 17 * * * *, 24h window). The Edge side
  --        additionally puts `version` in that derivation; this is the half that
  --        also covers the CLIENT-chosen keys, which cannot re-derive anything.
  --
  --        NARROW ON PURPOSE. `v_claimed` means this call inserted the row, so a
  --        rejection returned from step (3) — including an intent_mismatch
  --        against a row recording somebody's SUCCESS — never reaches here and
  --        can never free that row. And only `version_conflict` is released:
  --        every other code is a decision about the delta and deserves the same
  --        answer on the same key.
