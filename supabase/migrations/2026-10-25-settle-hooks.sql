-- Hearthrise — THE S2 SETTLE HOOKS: SIX S1 BODIES RESTATED WHOLE WITH NAMED CALLS
-- (lane S2, 2026-10-18; the S2 architecture check: no function body is patched
-- at apply time). STAGED. Game CLOSED: applies on its passing §3; Security
-- reviews it with every S2 money surface in the reopen gate.
-- Written by tools/build-settle-hooks.mjs (--check) from the bodies the chain
-- runs before this file; reviewed as the SQL below.
--
-- ── WHAT EACH RESTATEMENT ADDS (and nothing else moves) ────────────────────
-- hr_apply                a vendor_sell / vendor_sell_many debit of a locked item
--                         is refused `item_locked` (hook hr_item_locked).
-- hr_hunt_apply_member    a cover line naming a locked item is refused
--                         `item_locked`; THE LOOT FILTER (hook hr_hunt_loot_rules,
--                         after sell-to-cover, its gold through hr_apply); own
--                         drinks (kind 'mana') share the one consumable lane with
--                         food; BLESSINGS (hook hr_blessing_take, before the
--                         death-XP debit); the answer carries death_xp (the debited
--                         loss per fall), the number a death explanation shows.
-- hr_hunt_member_read     sell-to-cover never offers a locked item.
-- hr_hunt_party_view, hr_hunt_party_finder, hr_hunt_section_view
--                         the name players see is hr_character_name (per character).
-- The hooks live with their features: 2026-10-25-bag-rules.sql (hr_item_locked,
-- hr_hunt_loot_rules), 2026-10-25-blessings.sql (hr_blessing_take),
-- 2026-10-25-account-items.sql (hr_character_name).
--
-- ── THE PINS (§0) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Each body is replaced only over the S1 pre-image it was written from (md5 of
-- prosrc) or this file's own image; anything else moved meanwhile and is
-- refused, never clobbered. CREATE OR REPLACE keeps every grant; each is
-- re-asserted.
--
-- ── REVERSIBILITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Re-apply the S1 bodies: hr_apply from 2026-10-22-hunt-sessions-delete-away.sql,
-- hr_hunt_apply_member / hr_hunt_member_read / hr_hunt_section_view from
-- 2026-10-23-hunt-world-state.sql, hr_hunt_party_view / hr_hunt_party_finder from
-- 2026-10-23-hunt-party.sql. ORDER: after 2026-10-25-party-invites.sql (LAST S2

-- hr_apply restated 2026-09-14 (2026-09-14-hr-apply-restatement.sql) — chain depth 0.
-- This body is AUTHORED HERE. Do not add an anchored programmatic patch to it:
-- tests/patch-chain-guard.mjs refuses a third one, and the two before that are
-- how a body that moves gold came to exist in no file at all.
declare
  -- BLAST-RADIUS CLAMPS. NOT balance, NOT player-facing. They are the blast
  -- radius if an Edge Function is ever wrong or compromised, exactly as the
  -- clamps in clan_deposit (2026-08-08-clan-seat.sql:530) are. Set far above
  -- honest play.
  --
  -- ── WHAT THESE CLAMPS ACTUALLY BUY, STATED HONESTLY (Security, 2026-08-11) ──
  --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
  -- The flattering version of this control is "one compromised call cannot max
  -- a skill from zero". That is TRUE at 5,000,000 and at 12,000,000 and it is
  -- nearly WORTHLESS, because nothing limits a compromised engine to one call:
  -- hr_rate_gate allows 30 accrues/minute, so the reachable rate is 150M XP/min
  -- at 5M and 360M XP/min at 12M. Against an attacker with the engine, the
  -- per-call clamp is a speed bump measured in seconds either way.
  --
  -- What it DOES buy, and the reason it is worth having:
  --   1. It stops a single bad delta from an HONEST-BUT-BUGGY engine. The
  --      `interval_ms` class is the live example: one request field taken from
  --      the client turns a 12h absence into ~43.2M ticks instead of ~18,000 —
  --      a ~2400x mint that proposes roughly 6.8 BILLION XP. That is refused
  --      identically at 5M and at 12M. Almost every real defect looks like
  --      this: not "slightly too much", but three orders of magnitude too much.
  --   2. It keeps ledger rows small-grained, so anomaly detection has something
  --      to detect. A clamp is also a bucket size.
  --
  -- ⚠ A clamp rejection is therefore NOT automatically an incident. Before the
  --   degrade ladder in hr-accrue/index.ts it was closer to one — a rejection
  --   rolled back the watermark with the payment and bricked accrual. It is now
  --   recoverable, and honest play at maximum gear over a 24h cap can approach
  --   these numbers on its own. Read a rejection as EITHER an incident OR a
  --   balance change that outgrew its blast radius, and check
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs' clamp-headroom report before assuming which.
  --
  -- c_max_xp_delta: 5,000,000 -> 12,000,000 on 2026-08-11 (Security ruling).
  --   At 5M the worst honest case measured by clampGuard was inside the 60%
  --   HEADROOM line but close enough that a single balance change would fire
  --   it; at 12M the same worst case is ~23.6%. HEADROOM stays at 0.60 in
  --   tests/accrual-engine.mjs — moving BOTH the clamp and the line is how you
  --   arrive at a guard that structurally cannot fire. Only this one clamp
  --   moved; gold, items, kinds and progress all have real margin already.
  --   The surviving property is asserted, not documented: clampGuard requires
  --   c_max_xp_delta < 13,034,431 = xpForLevel(99), i.e. one call can still
  --   never carry a skill from 0 to the level cap.

  --   rejection moves neither watermark nor version — so an honest retry
  --   re-derives a byte-identical key and replays the stored rejection until
  --   hr_intents_prune, up to 25 hours later.
  --
  --   The `fight` codes have exactly that shape, and the trigger is a ROUTINE
  --   OPERATION rather than an attack: change a monster's hp in
  --   src/data/monsters.js and deploy the Edge payload BEFORE re-applying
  --   2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every honest checkpoint for that
  --   monster proposes an hp above the stale ceiling. Refused, key bricked,
  --   every player on that monster frozen for a day — and re-applying the
  --   catalogue would NOT unfreeze them, because the replay never re-evaluates.
  --
  --   THE RULE, STATED AS A PROPERTY RATHER THAN AS A LIST: release a claimed
  --   key when the refusal is a function of SERVER STATE THAT CAN CHANGE
  --   UNDERNEATH AN UNCHANGED DELTA — the row version, or the catalogue the
  --   clamp is re-derived from. Everything else is a decision about the delta
  --   itself and deserves the same answer on the same key. Nothing is released
  --   that EXECUTED anything: a rejection rolled the protected block back, so a
  --   re-run is a first run.
  --   ⚠ THE LIST ROTTED IN ONE DAY, exactly as predicted (b361 incident):
  --   Stonemason shipped to clients minutes before its hr_skills row landed,
  --   `unknown_skill` fired for two LIVE players, stored itself against their
  --   accrue keys, and "Try again" replayed the stored refusal after the
  --   catalogue was fixed — the F3 brick, second instance, severity incident.
  --   `unknown_skill` / `unknown_item` / `unknown_activity` are all functions
  --   of catalogue state (hr_skills / hr_items / hr_activities) and were
  --   always in the property's scope; they are now in the list. If you add a
  --   catalogue-validated refusal code to hr_apply, IT GOES HERE TOO.
  --   ⚠ b366 — THE EQUIP BLOCK JOINS THE LIST, AND IT IS THE SAME LESSON A
  --   SECOND TIME. Until b366 nothing could reach hr_apply's equip block
  --   through a player gesture (there was no equip verb anywhere in src/net,
  --   which is the root of the b362 dupe class), so its refusals were
  --   unreachable and none of them was ever considered here. The equip verb
  --   makes all five reachable, and FOUR of them are functions of a GENERATED
  --   catalogue — hr_equip_slots, hr_items, hr_item_slots — i.e. exactly the
  --   "server state that can change underneath an unchanged delta" the property
  --   above names. The routine operation that trips it is a deploy-order slip:
  --   add an item to src/data/items.js, deploy the Edge payload BEFORE
  --   re-applying 2026-08-11-catalogue.generated.sql, and every equip of that
  --   item is unknown_item — and STAYS unknown_item for that key even after the
  --   catalogue lands, because a replay never re-evaluates.
  --   `requirement_not_met` is here for the same reason with a different table:
  --   it is derived from player_skills through hr_level_from_xp, and an XP
  --   grant that lands between two attempts changes the answer to an unchanged
  --   delta.
  --   `bad_equip` is a SHAPE refusal and is here only because hr_apply raises
  --   it for a delta whose shape depends on nothing but itself — releasing it
  --   is harmless (the block rolled back) and keeping it off the list would
  --   brick a key on a client bug that a redeploy fixes.
  --   ⚠ `insufficient_item` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. "You do not own one" is a
  --   fact about the PLAYER'S OWN ROW, not about a catalogue, and it is the
  --   ownership check that makes equipping a conserving transfer. Releasing it
  --   would hand a client an unlimited number of free re-attempts on one key
  --   against a moving inventory — which is the retry loop a dupe wants.

  --        Revision 2 stored the ENTIRE hr_state_of envelope — inventory,
  --        fifteen skills, farm plots, progress — in player_intents.result, per
  --        intent, at up to 240 applies/min/player. That is a full state
  --        snapshot roughly every quarter second per player, retained 24 hours:
  --        ~2 KB × 240 × 60 × 24 = 690 MB PER PLAYER PER DAY at the rate limit,
  --        and this repo already has the receipt for what an unbounded journal
  --        does here (game_events: 1.6M rows / 229 MB, six players, 3.45 days).
  --        Now only `{ok}` (plus the error and its detail on a rejection) is
  --        stored — tens of bytes — and a REPLAY OF A SUCCESS RE-DERIVES the
  --        current state. That is strictly better for the caller too: a retry
  --        gets fresh state and a fresh version instead of a stale snapshot it
  --        would then have to discard. The contract is unchanged and is the one
  --        that matters: the same key applies the effect exactly once.

  --        ── ONE NAMESPACE, TWO KINDS OF KEY (review S6) ──────────────────
  --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
  --        `player_intents` is keyed on (user_id, intent_id) and NOTHING else,
  --        so a client-supplied uuid (market_list / market_cancel / market_buy
  --        all take p_intent_id straight from the browser) shares a namespace
  --        with keys the SERVER derives — the accrual engine's key is
  --        sha256(user, slot, watermark, …), and `accrued_to` is a value
  --        hr_load hands the client so it can render a countdown.
  --
  --        Left alone, that is a self-denial-of-service with a nasty shape: a
  --        player computes their own next accrual key, burns it with a market
  --        call, and every accrual from then on returns `replayed: true`,
  --        applies nothing, and never advances the watermark — silently, with
  --        ok:true, until hr_intents_prune deletes the row 24 hours later.
  --
  --        The fix is to notice that a replay must be a replay OF THE SAME
  --        THING. `player_intents.intent` already records what the key was
  --        claimed for; if the incoming call names a different one, this is not
  --        a retry, it is a collision — deliberate or accidental — and the
  --        honest answer is to refuse rather than to hand back someone else's
  --        decision. One comparison, and it hardens every intent in the system,
  --        not just accrual. (The accrual key is ALSO salted with hr_seed's
  --        server secret now, so it cannot be computed in the first place; these
  --        are two independent locks and the cheap one lives here.)

    -- ── (4b) THE LEDGER-DERIVED DAILY BUDGET (C5 / X3) ───────────────────
    --    introduced by 2026-08-11-apply-engine.sql
    -- The per-call clamps below are a blast radius for ONE call. Nothing
    -- restricts a compromised engine to one call — hr_rate_gate allows 30
    -- accrues/minute — so without a per-DAY ceiling the reachable rate is
    -- 518 BILLION XP/day, i.e. every skill in the game to 99 every two seconds.
    -- This is the ceiling. Design, numbers and the composition argument against
    -- the b307 per-absence cap: supabase/migrations/2026-08-11-daily-budget.sql.
    --
    -- WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY EXACTLY HERE:
    --   • AFTER the advisory lock and the `for update` above, so the sum and
    --     the row it will insert are inside one serialised critical section for
    --     this character. Two concurrent applies cannot both read a
    --     pre-insert world (hr_day_budget_used is VOLATILE — see its header).
    --   • AFTER the version check, so a stale caller pays `version_conflict`
    --     without a ledger scan.
    --   • AFTER the per-call clamps, and that ordering was decided by a test
    --     rather than by taste. With the budget checked first, the conservation
    --     fuzz's `gold_clamp` op — a deliberate 6.8e9-class delta — came back
    --     `daily_budget`, because the day's gold ceiling (25,000,000) is BELOW
    --     the per-call gold clamp (50,000,000). c_max_gold_delta would have
    --     become unreachable: a control that reads as a control in review and
    --     can never fire. Clamps answer "this ONE delta is insane"; the budget
    --     answers "you have had enough today". The specific diagnosis wins.
    --   • STILL INSIDE the protected block, before the state UPDATE and before
    --     the ledger row, so a breach rolls back everything the earlier blocks
    --     wrote through the same hr_reject/HR000 path as any other rejection.
    --     `daily_budget` never half-applies; the fuzz asserts that by
    --     reconciling after it.
    --   • GROSS inflow only. Netting a spend against a mint would give the
    --     budget a free reset button (mint 25M, buy something, mint again).
    --   • UNCONDITIONAL on journal.kind. `kind` is chosen by the caller; a
    --     budget that only counted kind='accrue' would be evaded by writing
    --     kind='trade'. Real transfers do not pass through hr_apply — market_buy
    --     credits gold itself and leaves gold_in NULL — so honest trading is

    -- claim time left the number dark between claims, so the envelope had
    -- nothing honest to project and the headline fell back to the last PAID
    -- rank's threshold (measured live: 400 shown, 779 counted).
    --
    -- SOURCE: hr_renown_of, server-derived, client-credited kills already
    -- subtracted. NOTHING is read from p_delta — no client value reaches this
    -- statement, and the delta the engine proposed cannot influence it.
    -- DELIBERATELY NO `version = version + 1` and NO `updated_at = now()`: the
    -- apply owns the version bump, and a second bump here would manufacture
    -- version_conflict refusals against the very client that just settled.
    --
    -- ⚠ C1 (Security, 2026-09-12) — ITS OWN SUBTRANSACTION, AND IT IS NOT
    --   ALLOWED TO FAIL THE SETTLE. Bare, this sat inside hr_apply's
    --   write-bearing block above the handlers, so ANY raise inside
    --   hr_renown_of landed in the bad_delta handler and rolled back the WHOLE

    --   a column Slice 3 owns; the reviewer injected the same shape on
    --   `streak_day_key` and a 7,777-gold PAID settle came back ok:false with
    --   the gold unchanged. A DISPLAY high-water must never be able to eat a
    --   player's earnings, so the block swallows its own failure and the settle
    --   proceeds with a stale — never wrong — renown figure.

  --        it. Only the decision is stored, never the state envelope (R5, and

  --        ── ONE EXCEPTION: A VERSION CONFLICT RELEASES THE KEY (b346) ──────
  --    introduced by 2026-08-15-intent-key-hygiene.sql
  --        "Same key, same answer" is the right contract for a decision about
  --        the DELTA — a clamp, an insufficiency, an unknown id. The caller must
  --        change something, and changing the key is how it says "this is a new
  --        attempt". `version_conflict` is not that. It is a statement about the
  --        caller's READ: nothing was applied, the protected block rolled back
  --        in full, and the DEFINED recovery is "re-read and try again".
  --
  --        Storing it turns an ordinary concurrency outcome into a lockout for
  --        any caller whose key cannot change. Measured on this database
  --        2026-08-15, rolled back:
  --            (1) apply, stale version      -> {ok:false, version_conflict}
  --            (2) retry SAME key, CORRECT   -> {ok:false, version_conflict,
  --                                              replayed:true}
  --            (3) control, NEW key, CORRECT -> {ok:true}
  --        Same delta, same correct version; only the key differed. The accrual
  --        engine's key is DERIVED from (user, slot, watermark, version, salt)
  --        and a rejection does not move the watermark, so before this it could
  --        re-derive a byte-identical, permanently-refused key — for up to 25
  --        hours (hr_intents_prune, 17 * * * *, 24h window). The Edge side
  --        additionally puts `version` in that derivation; this is the half that
  --        also covers the CLIENT-chosen keys, which cannot re-derive anything.
  --
  --        NARROW ON PURPOSE. `v_claimed` means this call inserted the row, so a
  --        rejection returned from step (3) — including an intent_mismatch
  --        against a row recording somebody's SUCCESS — never reaches here and
  --        can never free that row. And only `version_conflict` is released:
  --        every other code is a decision about the delta and deserves the same
  --        answer on the same key.
  if v_claimed
     and coalesce(v_out->>'ok', 'false') <> 'true'

  --        relied on for an audit trail sits INSIDE the block, so a rejection

  --        player_intents.result — which hr_intents_prune deletes after 24
  --        hours. The design says "treat any rejection as an incident"; an
  --        incident nobody can see the next morning is not one.
  --
  --        hr_record_rejection aggregates per (character, code, day) and
  --        classifies incident vs normal itself, so this is a bounded write —
