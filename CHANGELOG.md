# Hearthrise — Changelog

The welcome modal reads this file on first load after a new build. New entries
go at the top. Format: each version is a `## v0.x.x — YYYY-MM-DD` heading,
followed by bullets. Keep entries short and player-friendly (not commit-log style).

## v0.9.1-beta build 101 — 2026-05-03 (hot patch)

Bug-fix patch caught during the first live-site walkthrough.

- 🐛 **Bounty Board raw-HTML finally fixed for real.** The old regex-on-innerHTML approach fought with `image-fallback.js` and produced corrupted markup like `class="icon-fallback" style=...> Field Rat`. Rewrote `paintBountyMonsters` to use proper DOM API (createElement + appendChild) — the failure mode can't recur.
- 🚪 Click the idle activity bar in the topbar to jump straight to Activities. New-player quality-of-life.
- 👋 First-time-after-signup welcome modal — fires once per account, names the player, points at Activities.
- 🛒 Market "List an item" form had an olive-green background; now matches parchment.
- 📋 Added `TODO_BETA.md` with prioritized post-beta backlog.

## v0.9.1-beta — 2026-05-03

**Hearthrise looks like a real game now.** Massive UI rebuild to match the homestead-RPG vibe.

- 🎨 New character-sheet UI: parchment pages with gold corner flourishes + wax seal, instead of the old dashboard cards
- 🏠 New Hearthrise crest logo — cottage with rising sun above + wheat sheaves
- ✒️ Hand-drawn icons for every nav and topbar slot (24 SVG icons in a consistent style)
- 🌅 Atmospheric "homestead at golden hour" background — warm amber sky fading down through grass to deep forest
- 🔴 Wax-stamp red accents for primary actions (Sign In, Quests, active nav)
- 📜 Cinzel typography for headings; Quicksand for body — replaces generic sans
- 💬 Chat dock + welcome modal + bug-report system all themed
- 🔐 Cloud sync (sign in via Settings → Account) live for cross-device saves
- 🛒 Marketplace (player listings) lives at Market tab; premium store accessible from there
- 🗝 Dungeons accessible from a button inside Combat
- 📋 Beta invite system + signup display name field

**Gameplay**
- All 9 skills trainable, weapons + armor crafting, Bounty Board with marks rewards
- Companion system: Wolf, Beaver, Raccoon
- House upgrades: 8 rooms, account-wide bonuses

**Known limitations**
- Beta — expect some rough edges. Save backups roll automatically every 30s.
- Mobile is supported but desktop is more polished.
- Some achievements + the bestiary are still client-side only.
- Email confirmation links may need a fresh browser tab to complete sign-up.
