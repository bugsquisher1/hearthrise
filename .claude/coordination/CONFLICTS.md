# CONFLICTS

_Open conflicts — code, design, asset, gameplay, architecture, integration. **Never silently resolve a meaningful conflict.** Log it, route it to the owners, resolve with evidence, then move it to Resolved._

## Conflict types to watch
- **Code:** two agents editing overlapping lines/files.
- **Semantic (the dangerous kind — no git conflict):** two agents holding incompatible models of how a system should behave. Example: Game Designer says "cooking should improve combat effectiveness"; Systems says "cooking currently only modifies XP." No merge conflict, but a real design/system conflict. Flag it.
- **Design:** competing player-experience goals.
- **Asset:** style/consistency disagreements.
- **Architecture:** competing structural approaches.
- **Integration:** a change that breaks another verified change on merge.

## Open

### 2026-08-08 · SEMANTIC · Perk stacking power budget (Game Designer → Systems Engineer)
Homestead + renown + clan-level + proposed clan-wings all funnel `getBonus`; `allXP` could stack to ~+57%. Designer recommends re-scoping clan auto-level `PERKS` to baseline-only + a per-key soft cap, landed **with** the wings (clan-overhaul §7). Systems must rule on the cap mechanism before Wave 3 builds the wings.

### 2026-08-08 · DEPENDENCY · `raidPower` getBonus key (Game Designer → Systems Engineer)
Clan-overhaul spec introduces a new `getBonus('raidPower')` that `src/features/raids.js simulateStrike` must consume (clan-overhaul §4.3). Wave 3.

### 2026-08-08 · SEMANTIC · Auto-eat vs foodClass split (Game Designer owns the balance call)
Cooking taxonomy adds `foodClass: 'healing' | 'buff'`; auto-eat must filter to `'healing'` only (auto-eat = heal only, per design). Fish-line items with incidental combat buffs blur the line — Designer owns final classification (taxonomy §5.4). Wave 2, must land with #12.

### 2026-08-08 · DEPENDENCY · `snapshot.renown` for leaderboards (Game Designer → Systems Engineer)
Flagship Throne board needs `renown` written into the client save snapshot on save (leaderboards §3.2). Touches the fragile `snapshotG` allowlist — Systems change. Wave 3.
