-- Hearthrise — THE ENGINE CAPABILITY ALLOWLIST: the world tick's settle fence
--
--   ⚠ STAGED, NOT APPLIED. The Coordinator applies migrations; agents stage.
--
--   Companion derivation: tools/derive-grant-hygiene.mjs (§2's body is EXTRACTED)
--   Graded by: tests/run-sql-tests.mjs PART 1f-ii (HR_GRANT_HYGIENE_CHAIN, link 10)
--   Preflight: node tools/derive-grant-hygiene.mjs --check (in tests/run-smoke.mjs)
--
-- ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (Security M-2, 2026-09-21) ─────────────────────
-- 2026-09-21-world-tick-settle-fence.sql grants `hr_engine` EXECUTE on
-- `hr_tick_settle`. That grant is correct and is the whole point of the fence:
-- it is the ONE door the world tick has to player value, and the roster
-- withdrew the tick's raw `hr_apply` grant in the same chain.
--
-- What was not done is RECORD it. `hr_engine`'s EXECUTE allowlist is an
-- explicit list inside `hr_assert_grant_hygiene`, and on the assembled chain
-- the detector raises:
--
--   GRANT HYGIENE FAILED: {… "engine_execute_outside_allowlist":
--     ["hr_tick_settle(text,uuid,integer,text,bigint,timestamp with time zone,
--       timestamp with time zone,uuid,jsonb)"] …}
--
-- CLAUDE.md §6 names this function as THE detector for the client RPC surface,
-- and `cron.job` runs it nightly:
--
--   hr-grant-hygiene  [50 4 * * *]  select public.hr_assert_grant_hygiene(true)
--
-- So from 04:50 UTC the morning after the fence applies, the job raises every
-- night until this file lands.
--
-- ⚠ THE REAL COST IS NOT THE NOISE. It is that once the grant-hygiene job is
--   EXPECTED to be red, a genuine grant regression — an RPC handed to
--   `authenticated`, the class this detector exists to catch and the class the
--   original audit missed — becomes invisible. A detector that is always red
--   is not a detector. This is the same shape as S-1's "our own infrastructure
--   generates the alarm".
--
-- ⚠ APPLY ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. This file is step 3 of four and MUST NOT
--   TRAIL THE FENCE OVERNIGHT:
--     1. 2026-09-20-world-tick-roster.sql
--     2. 2026-09-21-world-tick-settle-fence.sql   ← the grant is made here
--     3. THIS FILE                                 ← the grant is recorded here
--     4. 2026-09-21-world-tick-cron.sql
--   Between 2 and 3 the nightly job raises. Steps 1-3 are safe and inert on
--   their own: a disarmed config row, two unreachable tables, one function
--   granted to one role, and no scheduled job.
--
-- ⚠ THIS FILE RESTATES A LIVE BODY, SO IT MOVES A LIVE HASH — which makes the
--   milestone's "MOVES NO LIVE HASH" claim true of each of the other three
--   files and FALSE OF THE MILESTONE. After applying:
--     node tests/live-hash-drift.mjs --live --write
--   expecting a move on `hr_assert_grant_hygiene` and NO move on `hr_apply`,
--   whys written from `--codediff`. That is the Coordinator's step, not this
--   lane's (CLAUDE.md §2: the baseline is Coordinator-only).
--
-- ── THE DANGEROUS SHAPE, SAID BEFORE THE FIX ────────────────────────────
-- The pressure a raising detector creates is to make the detector stop
-- raising. There are three ways and only one is a fix:
--   (a) revoke the grant       — the world tick has no door and cannot settle
--   (b) widen/delete check (7) — deletes the control
--   (c) record the entry, with a justification that re-derives the claim the
--       list demands                                            — this file
-- §4 therefore ships a MUTATION ARM: after installing, it grants `hr_engine`
-- EXECUTE on a throwaway probe and REQUIRES the detector to name it and to be
-- fatal about it. A detector that stopped firing fails this migration.
-- Coverage gets STRICTER here, never looser.
--
-- ── THE CLAIM THE ENTRY MAKES ───────────────────────────────────────────
-- 2026-08-11-grant-hygiene.sql states the bar on `c_engine_allow`: an entry is
-- a CLAIM that the function is "read-only or self-validating, and accepts no
-- target the caller is not already authorised for". `hr_tick_settle` is NOT
-- read-only; it is admitted on SELF-VALIDATING, and the long form of that
-- derivation is in the entry's own comment in §2 (lease, watermark CAS,
-- window/delta binding, version, then hr_apply re-validating regardless of
-- caller). NO NEW TARGET: `p_user` is the parameter the engine already hands
-- `hr_apply` and `hr_state_of`, and the holder of `hr_apply` can already write
-- any character it names — this function is strictly narrower than that.

-- ── 1. PREFLIGHT — fail closed if the thing being recorded is not there ──
-- A file that records an allowlist entry for a grant that does not exist is a
-- file that pre-approves a future grant nobody reviewed. Refuse rather than
-- quietly widen.

  -- S9 — THE hr_engine CAPABILITY PIN, MOVED HERE (Security, 2026-08-11)
  -- ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  -- It used to live in 2026-08-11-market-v2.sql §9(i), which is three defects
  -- at once and the reason it is now here:
  --
  --   1. IT DOES NOT RUN. market-v2 is UNAPPLIED and cannot be applied until
  --      the server owns gold and inventory. A pin inside an unapplied
  --      migration is a comment. hr_assert_grant_hygiene runs at every apply
  --      AND nightly via pg_cron, and its failures surface as maintenance_alerts.
  --   2. IT MATCHED ON `proname`. `p.proname <> all (array[...])` accepts ANY
  --      overload of an approved name — `hr_seed(text)` added next to
  --      `hr_seed(uuid,int,text)` would pass silently. Keyed on
  --      `p.oid::regprocedure::text` an overload is a different string and is
  --      therefore a finding, which is the correct answer.
  --   3. IT FILTERED `prokind = 'f'`. A PROCEDURE was invisible to it — exactly
  --      defect D1 that this file's own rewrite was written to fix, reproduced
  --      one section later.
  --
  -- ⚠ EVERY ENTRY CARRIES A ONE-LINE JUSTIFICATION. In the old list only entry
  --   8 did, which meant the first seven were "bounded and fine" by tradition.
  --   Adding an entry is a CLAIM: read-only or self-validating, and it accepts
  --   no target the caller is not already authorised for. Re-derive that for
  --   the whole list every time it changes.

    -- it is the ONLY route the tick has to player value: the roster WITHDREW
    -- the tick's raw hr_apply grant and this function replaced it. Its whole
    -- caller-supplied surface is a holder name, a (user, slot, channel), a
    -- version, a window [from,to), an idempotency uuid and a delta — and every
    -- one of those is CHECKED AGAINST THE DATABASE before a value moves:
    --   * THE LEASE. The caller must name a character the ROSTER handed it, in
    --     its own holder name, inside the lease window. hr_tick_roster is
    --     executable by `hr_tick` and by NOTHING ELSE, and hr_engine is
    --     asserted NOT to hold it (fence e19), so a settling role structurally
    --     cannot stamp its own lease. "Choose whose world ticks" is closed one
    --     level deeper than a grant.
    --   * THE WATERMARK CAS, under `select ... for update` on player_state
    --     taken BEFORE any comparison: a window at or after the settled mark is
    --     accepted, a window behind it is refused whatever its version and
    --     whatever its key. This holds against a client accrue, a client
    --     collect, a second tick process and a replay of the same call.
    --   * THE DECLARED WINDOW IS BOUND TO THE PAID ONE
    --     (`p_delta->>'accrued_to' = p_window_to`), so a caller cannot name
    --     ten seconds and hand over an hour.
    --   * THE VERSION, and then hr_apply re-validates every invariant regardless
    --     of caller — ONE call site, after every check, no tick-specific clamp
    --     and no fast path.
    -- NO NEW TARGET: p_user is the parameter the engine already passes to
    -- hr_apply and hr_state_of. The holder of hr_apply can already WRITE any
    -- character it names; this is strictly NARROWER than what it already has.
    -- WHY THE ENGINE NEEDS IT: hr_apply's impersonation seam tests
    -- `v_role = 'hr_engine'` literally, so the tick cannot reach hr_apply as
    -- `hr_tick` at all (S-1, proved by execution); the edge arrives as
    -- hr_engine and this is the door it knocks on. Granted to hr_engine ONLY —
    -- fence e18c asserts `hr_tick` does NOT hold it, because that would be
    -- a door that cannot open and would journal a forgery alert every fire.

    -- ⚠ THE LARGEST SINGLE WIDENING SINCE hr_apply: three writers at once, and
    -- ONE OF THEM MOVES VALUE BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS. The c_engine_allow claim is
    -- "read-only or SELF-VALIDATING, and it accepts no target the caller is not
    -- already authorised for". None of these is read-only, so the whole claim
    -- rests on the other two clauses, re-derived rather than asserted:
    --
    --   SELF-VALIDATING. The entire caller-supplied surface of the three is a
    --   character slot, an idempotency uuid, a version, and then: an ITEM ID +
    --   COUNT + ASK (list), a LISTING ID (cancel), a LISTING ID + COUNT (buy).
    --   No price crosses on a buy — ask_each is read off the listing row under
    --   its own lock — no timestamp, no name, no fee rate, no counterparty. The
    --   item must be `tradeable` in the generated, client-unwritable hr_items;
    --   the tax rate and every ceiling come from hr_market_config; the seller
    --   name is derived from profiles; every clock is now(). Each function
    --   re-reads its listing FOR UPDATE and re-validates under hr_apply's own
    --   advisory lock, refuses a stale version, and is clamped per call (a gross
    --   ceiling) AND per DAY (list churn; gold sent; gold received) from the
    --   append-only ledger — the dimension a rate limit does not bound.
    --
    --   THE TARGET CLAUSE, STATED HONESTLY (Security M2). The earlier draft
    --   claimed "the engine cannot select a victim". That is FALSE and is the
    --   correction: the engine holds hr_market_list(p_user, …) for ANY user, so a
    --   compromised engine can open a listing FOR a victim it names and then
    --   settle it to itself with hr_market_buy — it can choose both sides of a
    --   trade. What admits these three is therefore NOT "no victim" but BOUNDED
    --   BLAST RADIUS: every path is a CONSERVED transfer of TRADEABLE items
    --   (buyer -gross, seller +net, tax burned — nothing minted, nothing an
    --   honest player did not already own), the item must be `tradeable` in the
    --   client-unwritable hr_items, BOTH SIDES ARE JOURNALLED (transfer +
    --   self_trade in meta), and the flows are CLAMPED PER DAY off the
    --   append-only ledger on three dimensions the engine cannot widen: escrowed
    --   item quantity (list), gold sent (buy) and gold received (buy).
    --   ⚠ THOSE CLAMPS ARE THE MARKET'S OWN, NOT hr_day_budget_check. A market
    --   transfer is conserved, so it is deliberately absent from the mint
    --   budget's qty dimension — charging a sale to the seller's daily inflow
    --   would let a stranger drain their accrual (the griefing vector in
    --   hr_market_buy's header). So the item-drain and gold-move ceilings live
    --   here and only here. p_user is the parameter the engine already passes to
    --   hr_apply.
    --
    --   WHY THE ENGINE NEEDS THEM: hr_apply is single-character by construction
    --   — one lock, one version, one journal target — so a delta shape that
    --   could move a second player's gold would be the most dangerous key in the
    --   engine's vocabulary. Without these three, the only writer of a
    --   cross-player transfer is the client, which is the hole this whole

  --     POLICY AT ALL is a grant nothing intends to use: the only thing between
  --     it and the table is row-level security, and one `create policy` — or
  --     one `alter table ... disable row level security` typed during an
  --     incident — turns it into a client-writable table. Security found six of
  --     them live (hr_castle_*, hr_hunt_*): pure content catalogues carrying
  --     anon/authenticated INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
  --     WHY IT IS A BASELINE AND NOT A BAN: 21 further tables were in this class
  --     when the check was written (clan_*, world_event_*, raid_*, maintenance_*,
  --     display_names, leaderboard_meta) — all written only by SECURITY DEFINER
  --     RPCs, all dead grants, and none of them safe to sweep in the same change
  --     that introduced the detector. They are RECORDED in
  --     hr_client_write_baseline, which makes each one a claim somebody has to
  --     justify, and makes anything NEW fatal.
  --     service_role is deliberately NOT in the grantee list: Supabase's platform
  --     default grants it every privilege on every table in public, so including
  --     it would report all 40-odd tables and the check could never be strict.
  --     That is a platform posture and a separate program; stated here so its
  --     absence is a decision rather than an oversight.
  --     b350 (Security batch 5) — THE DETECTOR TAKEOVER. This query no longer
  --     reads information_schema.role_table_grants, which reports SQL-standard
  --     privileges ONLY: it cannot see MAINTAIN (the PG17 VACUUM/ANALYZE/CLUSTER/
  --     REINDEX/REFRESH privilege) and it OMITS materialized views entirely. Both
  --     are exactly where dead client write grants hid — 28 MAINTAIN pairs and the
  --     leaderboard_ranked matview were invisible to every nightly run.
  --     has_table_privilege over pg_class sees the full PG17 vocabulary AND every
  --     relkind. Two arms, the same meaning check (4) has always had:
  --       ARM 1 — a verb NO CLIENT EVER NEEDS, on ANY relation (table, partition
  --               or MATVIEW): TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, and now MAINTAIN. A
  --               write policy is no defence against any of these, so the grant is
  --               a finding wherever it lives.
  --       ARM 2 — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on a table with RLS ON and NO write policy,
  --               minus hr_client_write_baseline. Unchanged. Matviews carry no RLS
  --               and cannot be written through any path, so an i/u/d bit on one is
  --               inert and deliberately NOT arm 2's business.
  --     PUBLIC is not enumerated separately: a grant to PUBLIC makes
  --     has_table_privilege true for anon AND authenticated, so it surfaces under
  --     both without a third grantee.
